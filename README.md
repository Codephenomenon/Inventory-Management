# Inventory Management

This project was created for my Server-side programming class at the University of Central Missouri. My vision for this project
is a management tool for an online storefront, where users can process customer orders and keep track of database inventory. The user starts
off by registering for an account and logging in, using PHP sessions to keep track of user data. Users also have the ability to search through
the inventory database and add items to the database if need be.

## Getting Started

Use a local environment such as XAMPP to host the project on localhost, place folder inside htdocs. Inside phpMyAdmin run the database and insertion
scripts to create the database and fill it with data.

## Built With
